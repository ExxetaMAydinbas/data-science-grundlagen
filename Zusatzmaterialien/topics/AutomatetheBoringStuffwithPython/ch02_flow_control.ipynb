    "By using expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False` (also called **conditions**), you can write programs that make decisions on what code to execute and what code to skip. You can also execute code over and over again in a **loop** while a certain condition evaluates to `True`. The `break` and `continue` statements are useful if you need to exit a loop or jump back to the loop’s start.\n",
