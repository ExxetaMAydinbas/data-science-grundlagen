Once the program execution returns from spam, that *local scope is destroyed*, and there is no longer a variable named eggs. So when your program tries to run `print(eggs)`, Python gives you an error saying that `eggs` is not defined. This makes sense if you think about it; when the program execution is in the global scope, no local scopes exist, so there can’t be any local variables. This is why only global variables can be used in the global scope."
