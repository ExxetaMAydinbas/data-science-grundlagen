You can even write Python code to access the clipboard for copying and pasting text.\n",

    "\n",
    "Text is a common form of data, and Python comes with many helpful string methods to process the text stored in string values. You will make use of indexing, slicing, and string methods in almost every Python program you write.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programs you are writing now don’t seem too sophisticated—they don’t have graphical user interfaces with images and colorful text. So far, you’re displaying text with `print()` and letting the user enter text with `input()`. However, the user can quickly enter large amounts of text through the clipboard. This ability provides a useful avenue for writing programs that manipulate massive amounts of text. These text-based programs might not have flashy windows or graphics, but they can get a lot of useful work done quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to manipulate large amounts of text is reading and writing files directly off the hard drive. You’ll learn how to do this with Python in Chapter 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "That just about covers all the basic concepts of Python programming! You’ll continue to learn new concepts throughout the rest of this book, but you now know enough to start writing some useful programs that can automate tasks. If you’d like to see a collection of short, simple Python programs built from the basic concepts you’ve learned so far, check out https://github.com/asweigart/pythonstdiogames/."

    "Write a function named `printTable()` that takes a list of lists of strings and displays it in a well-organized table with each column right-justified. Assume that all the inner lists will contain the same number of strings. For example, the value could look like this:\n",

    "Hint: your code will first have to find the longest string in each of the inner lists so that the whole column can be wide enough to fit all the strings. You can store the maximum width of each column as a list of integers. The `printTable()` function can begin with `colWidths = [0] * len(tableData)`, which will create a list containing the same number of 0 values as the number of inner lists in `tableData`. That way, `colWidths[0]` can store the width of the longest string in `tableData[0]`, `colWidths[1]` can store the width of the longest string in `tableData[1]`, and so on. You can then find the largest value in the colWidths list to find out what integer width to pass to the `rjust()` string method."
